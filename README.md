# bitquilt

This repo contains a an Arduino sketch written in C for the Peggy 2 light emitting pegboard. The sketch presents a fascinating and endlessly scrolling "patchwork quilt" of bits designed by D. Sleator in 1976. The pattern is computationally simple enough to be generated rapidly by the Peggy's microcontroller, but also surprisingly interesting and variable.
